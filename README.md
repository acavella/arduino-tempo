# Arduino Tempo
Arduino Uno WiFi, solar powered weather station that reports data to wunderground.com in real time.

This project is inspired by and borrows from many other weather projects found around the internet.  In attempt to credit those who I have borrowed from:

- Dan Fein: [WiFi Weather Station] (https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Dan/arduino-weather-station-4ed7a7?ref=user&ref_id=3787&offset=0)
